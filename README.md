# Covid--19-Tweets-Sentiment-Analysis
#Aarushi Agarwal


Covid-19 has created a new normal to our way of life. As the businesses are opening, a lot of analysis is
going on over some big questions – “Are people ready to move out of their houses?”, “Is work from home
the way it is going to be from now on?” , “What are their emotions about the change?” ,“About covid-19?”
In this project, we built a model based on Naive Bayes algorithm, to analyze the sentiments of people via
tweets from March till June 2020 and classified them as positive or negative. Our analysis shows us that
the number of positive tweets has been consistently higher throughout the duration. Opposite to what some
of the media houses are telling us, there is a lot positivity around, in terms of fighting this pandemic,being
supportive towards policies and helping each other tackling one of the biggest pandemics which has forced
us into our homes.
